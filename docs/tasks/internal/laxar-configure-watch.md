# The _laxar-configure-watch_ Task

> For a given flow target, generates configuration for  [_watch_](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch) targets.

This does not actually start the watch task, because that would immediately block the grunt main thread for other tasks, as well as for additional flow targets to be configured for watching.
Usually, the watch task is started together with *connect* by the [*laxar-develop*](../laxar-develop.md) main task.

The generated watcher configuration is stored under `{dest}/{target}/work/watch-configuration.json`.
Here, *dest* refers to the configured destination directory (usually `var/flows`), and *target* corresponds to the flow target that was specified when running the task.


## Overview

*Note:* This task is an *internal building block* used by the grunt-laxar main tasks, and not considered a part of the stable API.

*Run this task with the `grunt laxar-configure laxar-configure-watch:{target}` command.*

Usually it does not make sense to run the task like this without also executing *watch* and *connect*, since otherwise the task runner would simply exit.
However, you may run it in this manner in order to inspect the generated watcher configuration.

The possible targets are determined by the configuration which is generated by the [*laxar-configure*](../laxar-configure.md) task.
If used without *laxar-configure*, the task targets, files and options may be specified manually according to the grunt
[Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.


## Options

### options.watchBowerComponents

*Default:* `false`

By default, no watchers are configured for anything installed as a bower component.
Depending on the project, this can lead to considerable CPU usage savings, but you may have to restart your development server after updating a bower dependency.
You can change this behavior by setting `options.watchBowerComponents` to `true`, so that the folder `bower_components` is no longer ignored.
